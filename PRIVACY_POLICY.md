# Privacy Policy for MultiView Any Video

Effective date: February 24, 2026

## Summary

MultiView Any Video is a browser extension that lets users view multiple selected video tabs in one dashboard.

We do not sell personal data and do not use personal data for advertising.

## Data We Access

To function, the extension may access:
- Tab metadata for open tabs (such as tab ID, title, URL, favicon)
- Video/audio streams from tabs explicitly selected by the user
- Local extension storage for selected tab IDs and order

## How Data Is Used

Data is used only to:
- Show selectable tabs in the popup
- Start and maintain video capture for selected tabs
- Render selected streams in the dashboard
- Persist selected tab list and ordering locally

## Data Sharing

- We do not transmit captured video/audio content to our servers.
- We do not share user data with third parties for marketing.
- WebRTC/STUN may contact Google STUN servers for connection negotiation as part of browser media transport.

## Data Retention

- Selected tab IDs/order are stored locally in Chrome extension storage until changed or extension removal.
- Captured media streams are in-memory during runtime and are not stored permanently by the extension.

## User Controls

Users can:
- Change selected tabs at any time
- Clear extension data by removing/reinstalling the extension
- Stop using the extension at any time

## Security

We rely on Chrome extension security boundaries and least-necessary permissions for functionality.
